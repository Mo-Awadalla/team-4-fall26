/**
 * Where the basemap comes from in development.
 *
 * In production the PMTiles archive sits in the site bucket and is served by
 * the same CloudFront distribution as the page, so the browser fetches it
 * same-origin. Nothing builds it into `static/`: it is 31 MB, it changes a few
 * times a year, and committing it would put it in every clone and every
 * deploy.
 *
 * So locally there is no `/tiles` to fetch and the maps simply did not draw.
 * Proxying the prefix to the deployed site fixes that without a copy on disk;
 * range requests pass straight through. `.claude/launch.json` fills this in
 * from `terraform output site_url`.
